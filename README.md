<h3 align="center">Senior Salesforce Developer & Consultant</h3>

Glad you come across my profile, Let's connect ! 

I'm a Salesforce enthusiast and Senior Developer with over 5 years of hands-on experience. 

Like many others, I too stumbled into the Salesforce ecosystem unexpectedly, and it turned out to be a fortunate discovery for me. 

I love and excel in problem-solving and developing robust Salesforce solutions across various domains including Sales, Service, Financial Services Cloud (FSC), and Experience Cloud. Beyond this, I enjoy sharing my insights through Salesforce blogs, aiming to inspire and empower fellow professionals in the ecosystem.
